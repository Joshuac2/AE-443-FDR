Both the horizontal and vertical stabilizer are initially sized per Raymer's recommended 25\% and 12.5\% of $S_{wing}$.\cite{raymer}  Location of the stabilizers, as notated as the distance between the $\text{MAC}_{\text{wing}}$ and $\text{MAC}_{\text{stabilizers}}$.

\subsubsection{Horizontal Stabilizer}
SAM Mk I uses a standard tail configuration.  The horizontal stabilizer is initially sized to be 25\% of $S_{wing}$.  This provides a starting point from which to begin stability analysis.  Use of an inverted NASA SC(2)-0412 airfoil for the horizontal stabilizer is proposed to provide a counter moment to the lifting effects of the wing.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Vertical Stabilizer}
The vertical stabilizer is sized to be approximately 12.5\% of $S_{wing}$.  Additional attention must be directed at the vertical stabilizer to ensure directional stability.  A symmetrical airfoil is desired for the vertical stabilizer to improve the directional stability by counteracting any yaw-moments.  Due to its thin profile and symmetrical form factor, the NACA 0012 is selected for the vertical tail.  Yaw-directional trim tabs are located on the aft 5\% chordwise trailing edge of the vertical tail to provide a trim factor.

\subsection{Control Surfaces}
Several control surfaces are built into the wing, horizontal stabilizer, and vertical stabilizer.  The main wing contains a flap mechanism from spanwise locations $11.5$ ft to $69.1$ ft and deflects a maximum of $\delta_F = 30\degree$.  An initial aileron sizing has determined potential placement from $72$ ft to $90$ ft and has a deflection angle of $\pm 15\degree$.  During cruise, the ailerons lock into $\delta_f = 0\degree$ and outboard flap mechanism unlocks and deploys as a flaperon system to mitigate controllability issues at transonic cruise stage.  A trade study was conducted to determine whether SAM Mk I should lock ailerons and implement flaperons for the transonic cruise stage and it was determined to be more efficient to use flaperon systems at higher speeds and ailerons at slower speeds.  The rudder is located on the vertical tail and spans the entire length of the tail, $27$ ft, as is normal in comparable aircraft.  The maximum deflection angle of the rudder is $\pm 15\degree$.  The elevators are located on the horizontal stabilizer and spans from $2$ ft to $65$ ft.  Yet another trade study is taking place to determine the selection of trim tabs or a trimmable horizontal stabilizer.

\subsection{Modeling and Simulation}
A combination of OpenVSP and Athena Vortex Lattice software is used to model SAM Mk I.  The OpenVSP model (Figure \ref{fig:simA}) provided a stepping stone in visualizing a preform of the aircraft during preliminary design stages.  OpenVSP was soon combined with AVL (Figure \ref{fig:simB}) to provide another blackbox procedure to simulating the controlability matrix.
